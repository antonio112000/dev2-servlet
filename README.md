Deployment of java servlet to Tomcat Apache server


For this project, i created a java entreprise project with intelliJ where i was able to choose "WEB application" as my project template and added the tomcat-apache-9.0.58 as the application server.
after selecting servlet as dependencies,the project creates many files one of which is the web page that contains the link to the servlet.
